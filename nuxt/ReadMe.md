setup nuxt js 

Sure, here are the steps to set up a basic Nuxt.js project:

First, you need to make sure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/.

Open your terminal and run the following command to install the Nuxt.js CLI globally:

lua
Copy code
npm install -g create-nuxt-app
Once the installation is complete, create a new Nuxt.js project by running the following command:
lua
Copy code
create-nuxt-app my-project
Follow the prompts in the terminal to configure your project. You can choose to use either the Universal mode or the SPA mode, select a CSS framework, and configure other options.

Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd my-project
Start the development server by running the following command:
Copy code
npm run dev
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see the default Nuxt.js homepage.
Congratulations, you've successfully set up a basic Nuxt.js project! From here, you can start customizing your project by adding pages, components, and configuring your app.

let's be nuxj.js assistance and help me to build a file uploader. This uploads file to s3 bucket.
Sure, I'd be happy to help you build a file uploader in Nuxt.js that uploads files to an S3 bucket. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Install the AWS SDK for JavaScript using npm:
```
npm install aws-sdk

```
In your Nuxt.js project, create a new file called awsConfig.js in the plugins directory. In this file, add the following code:
```
import AWS from 'aws-sdk'

AWS.config.update({
  accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
  region: process.env.AWS_REGION
})

export default AWS
```
In your nuxt.config.js file, add the following to load the awsConfig.js plugin:
```
plugins: [
  { src: '~/plugins/awsConfig

```


upload to azure blob storage
Sure, here are the steps to upload a file to Azure Blob Storage in a Nuxt.js app:

Install the Azure Storage Blob package using npm:
```
npm install @azure/storage-blob
```
In your Nuxt.js project, create a new file called azureBlob.js in the plugins directory. In this file, add the following code:
```
import { BlobServiceClient } from '@azure/storage-blob'

const connectionString = process.env.AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING
const blobServiceClient = BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(connectionString)

export default blobServiceClient
In your nuxt.config.js file, add the following to load the azureBlob.js plugin:
css
Copy code
plugins: [
  { src: '~/plugins/azureBlob.js', mode: 'client' }
]
```
Create a new Vue component that contains a form with a file input field and a submit button. When the user selects a file and submits the form, you can use the BlobServiceClient instance to upload the file to Azure Blob Storage.
Here's an example of how you can implement this:

```
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Upload file to Azure Blob Storage</h1>
    <form @submit.prevent="onSubmit">
      <div>
        <label for="file">Select file:</label>
        <input type="file" id="file" ref="fileInput" />
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Upload</button>
    </form>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import blobServiceClient from '~/plugins/azureBlob'

export default {
  methods: {
    async onSubmit() {
      const file = this.$refs.fileInput.files[0]
      const containerName = 'my-container'
      const blobName = file.name
      const containerClient = blobServiceClient.getContainerClient(containerName)
      const blockBlobClient = containerClient.getBlockBlobClient(blobName)
      const uploadOptions = { blobHTTPHeaders: { blobContentType: file.type } }
      await blockBlobClient.uploadBrowserData(file, uploadOptions)
      console.log('File uploaded successfully')
    }
  }
}
</script>
```
Note that this example assumes that you have set the AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING environment variable to the connection string for your Azure Blob Storage account. You can obtain this connection string from the Azure portal. Also, make sure that the user running the Nuxt.js app has the necessary permissions to upload files to the Blob Storage container.

In this code, example can I resume the file upload?
Yes, you can resume an interrupted file upload to Azure Blob Storage by using the uploadStream method of the BlockBlobClient class.

Here's an updated example of the onSubmit method that supports resuming file uploads:

```
async onSubmit() {
  const file = this.$refs.fileInput.files[0]
  const containerName = 'my-container'
  const blobName = file.name
  const containerClient = blobServiceClient.getContainerClient(containerName)
  const blockBlobClient = containerClient.getBlockBlobClient(blobName)
  const existingBlob = await blockBlobClient.getProperties().catch(() => null)
  if (existingBlob) {
    const offset = existingBlob.contentLength
    const uploadOptions = { blobHTTPHeaders: { blobContentType: file.type } }
    await blockBlobClient.uploadStream(file.slice(offset), offset, undefined, uploadOptions)
  } else {
    const uploadOptions = { blobHTTPHeaders: { blobContentType: file.type } }
    await blockBlobClient.uploadBrowserData(file, uploadOptions)
  }
  console.log('File uploaded successfully')
}
```
In this updated example, we first check if the blob already exists in the container by calling the getProperties method on the BlockBlobClient instance. If the blob exists, we resume the upload by calling the uploadStream method with the offset parameter set to the size of the existing blob, and the sourceOffset parameter set to undefined to indicate that we want to resume the upload from where it left off. If the blob does not exist, we upload the file as usual using the uploadBrowserData method.

Note that in order to resume an upload, the file being uploaded must have been sliced into chunks with the correct size and offset. This slicing can be done using the File API in the browser.




```
async onSubmit() {
  const file = this.$refs.fileInput.files[0]
  const containerName = 'my-container'
  const blobName = file.name
  const containerClient = blobServiceClient.getContainerClient(containerName)
  const blockBlobClient = containerClient.getBlockBlobClient(blobName)
  const existingBlob = await blockBlobClient.getProperties().catch(() => null)
  const fileSize = file.size
  const maxBlockSize = 4 * 1024 * 1024 // 4 MB
  const numberOfBlocks = Math.ceil(fileSize / maxBlockSize)
  const blockIds = []
  let offset = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < numberOfBlocks; i++) {
    const blockId = btoa(`block-${i}`)
    blockIds.push(blockId)
    const blockData = file.slice(offset, offset + maxBlockSize)
    const uploadOptions = {
      blobHTTPHeaders: { blobContentType: file.type },
      onProgress: progress => console.log(`Uploaded ${progress.loadedBytes} bytes`)
    }
    if (existingBlob && offset < existingBlob.contentLength) {
      await blockBlobClient.stageBlockWithResponse(blockId, blockData, offset, {
        leaseAccessConditions: { modifiedAccessConditions: { ifMatch: existingBlob.etag } },
        ...uploadOptions
      })
    } else {
      await blockBlobClient.stageBlockWithResponse(blockId, blockData, offset, uploadOptions)
    }
    offset += maxBlockSize
  }
  if (existingBlob) {
    const uploadOptions = { blobHTTPHeaders: { blobContentType: file.type } }
    await blockBlobClient.commitBlockListWithResponse(blockIds, {
      leaseAccessConditions: { modifiedAccessConditions: { ifMatch: existingBlob.etag } },
      ...uploadOptions
    })
  } else {
    const uploadOptions = { blobHTTPHeaders: { blobContentType: file.type } }
    await blockBlobClient.commitBlockListWithResponse(blockIds, uploadOptions)
  }
  console.log('File uploaded successfully')
}
```
In this updated example, we first check if the blob already exists in the container by calling the getProperties method on the BlockBlobClient instance. We then determine the size of the file and the maximum size of each block. We divide the file into blocks of the maximum size, and upload each block using the stageBlockWithResponse method of the BlockBlobClient instance. We keep track of the block IDs in an array.

After all blocks have been uploaded, we call the commitBlockListWithResponse method to commit the blocks to the blob. If the blob already exists, we pass the etag of the existing blob to the modifiedAccessConditions property of the leaseAccessConditions parameter to ensure that the blob has not been modified since we last checked it. We then pass the array of block IDs to the commitBlockListWithResponse method.

Note that in order to use chunking to resume an interrupted file upload, the file being uploaded must have been sliced into chunks of the correct size and uploaded in the correct order.

can you refactor above code in smaller functions?
Yes, of course! Here's a refactored version of the onSubmit method that breaks the file upload process into smaller functions:

```
async onSubmit() {
  const file = this.$refs.fileInput.files[0]
  const containerName = 'my-container'
  const blobName = file.name
  const blockBlobClient = blobServiceClient
    .getContainerClient(containerName)
    .getBlockBlobClient(blobName)
  const existingBlob = await getExistingBlob(blockBlobClient)
  const blockIds = await uploadBlocks(blockBlobClient, file, existingBlob)
  await commitBlocks(blockBlobClient, blockIds, file.type, existingBlob)
  console.log('File uploaded successfully')
}

async function getExistingBlob(blockBlobClient) {
  try {
    return await blockBlobClient.getProperties()
  } catch (error) {
    return null
  }
}

async function uploadBlocks(blockBlobClient, file, existingBlob) {
  const fileSize = file.size
  const maxBlockSize = 4 * 1024 * 1024 // 4 MB
  const numberOfBlocks = Math.ceil(fileSize / maxBlockSize)
  const blockIds = []
  let offset = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < numberOfBlocks; i++) {
    const blockId = btoa(`block-${i}`)
    blockIds.push(blockId)
    const blockData = file.slice(offset, offset + maxBlockSize)
    const uploadOptions = {
      blobHTTPHeaders: { blobContentType: file.type },
      onProgress: progress => console.log(`Uploaded ${progress.loadedBytes} bytes`)
    }
    if (existingBlob && offset < existingBlob.contentLength) {
      await blockBlobClient.stageBlockWithResponse(blockId, blockData, offset, {
        leaseAccessConditions: { modifiedAccessConditions: { ifMatch: existingBlob.etag } },
        ...uploadOptions
      })
    } else {
      await blockBlobClient.stageBlockWithResponse(blockId, blockData, offset, uploadOptions)
    }
    offset += maxBlockSize
  }
  return blockIds
}

async function commitBlocks(blockBlobClient, blockIds, blobContentType, existingBlob) {
  const uploadOptions = { blobHTTPHeaders: { blobContentType } }
  if (existingBlob) {
    await blockBlobClient.commitBlockListWithResponse(blockIds, {
      leaseAccessConditions: { modifiedAccessConditions: { ifMatch: existingBlob.etag } },
      ...uploadOptions
    })
  } else {
    await blockBlobClient.commitBlockListWithResponse(blockIds, uploadOptions)
  }
}
```
In this refactored version, we define three separate functions: getExistingBlob, uploadBlocks, and commitBlocks. The onSubmit function then calls these functions in sequence to upload the file to Azure Blob Storage.

The getExistingBlob function checks if the blob already exists in the container and returns its properties, or returns null if the blob does not exist.

The uploadBlocks function divides the file into blocks and uploads them to Azure Blob Storage using the stageBlockWithResponse method of the BlockBlobClient instance. The function also checks if the blob already exists and resumes the upload if it does.

The commitBlocks function commits the blocks to the blob using the commitBlockListWithResponse method of the BlockBlobClient instance. The function also checks if the blob already exists and passes the etag of the existing blob to the modifiedAccessConditions property of the leaseAccessConditions parameter if necessary.

Breaking the file upload process into smaller functions makes the code easier to understand and maintain, and also allows for easier testing and reuse

```
import { BrowserFileStorage } from '@azure/storage-file-upload'
async function onSubmit() {
  const file = this.$refs.fileInput.files[0]
  const containerName = 'my-container'
  const blobName = file.name
  const browserFileStorage = new BrowserFileStorage()
  const transferProgress = {}
  const maxRetries = 3
  let retryCount = 0
  while (retryCount < maxRetries) {
    try {
      await browserFileStorage.upload(file, {
        maxSingleShotSize: 4 * 1024 * 1024, // 4 MB
        blobHTTPHeaders: { blobContentType: file.type },
        onProgress: progress => console.log(`Uploaded ${progress.loadedBytes} bytes`),
        containerName,
        blobName,
        metadata: {},
        transferProgress
      })
      console.log('File uploaded successfully')
      break
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(`Upload failed: ${error}`)
      if (transferProgress.uploadedBytes > 0) {
        console.log(`Resuming upload from ${transferProgress.uploadedBytes} bytes`)
      } else {
        console.log(`Retrying upload... (${retryCount + 1} of ${maxRetries} retries)`)
      }
      retryCount++
    }
  }
  if (retryCount === maxRetries) {
    console.log(`Upload failed after ${maxRetries} retries`)
  }
}

```
